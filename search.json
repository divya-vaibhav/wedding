["Divya &amp; Vaibhav Saturday, December 9 10am-Noon : Dev Devak &amp; Gruh Yagnya Pooja (ritual) to invite all the deities and familial ancestors to the wedding. 1-3pm : Vyahi Bhojan &amp; Lunch The groom’s family hosts the bride’s family for lunch. Previously, the bride’s parents were restricted to have food at the groom’s home until a son was born to their daughter (bride) and son-in-law (groom) !!! So, the groom’s family invited the bride’s family for a feast before the wedding. This tradition is no more, and rightly so. Now, Vyahi Bhojan serves the purpose of the two extended families and the guests to better know each other. 9am: Breakfast 4-6pm : Vaagnishchay, Seemanth Poojan &amp; Vihin Bhet Vaagnishchay is a prayer for the wedding to go smoothly. Seemanth Poojan literally translates to “worshipping the boundary. ” Originally, this pooja was performed to welcome the groom – as he entered within the boundary of the bride’s village – for the wedding. Today, as part of this pooja, the bride’s father offers the groom a seat on a decorated chowranga (a low stool), a coconut and gifts. Likewise, the groom’s father does the pooja for the bride. The groom’s and bride’s fathers, then, welcome and introduce all elders of the other’s family to theirs. Vihin Bhet translates to the meeting of the bride’s and groom’s mother. The bride’s mother welcomes the groom’s mother and her friends, applies kumkum (red powder), and breaks small sugar discs on their head. 6:30-9pm : Game Night &amp; Dinner In this longstanding tradition, we will play fun and interactive games over dinner on the wedding eve. The origins and purpose of this tradition are unclear, and often cause of heated debate among wedding historians ☺ Sunday, December 10 (morning) 7-8am : Ushti Halad Time to get ready for the wedding! During Ushti Halad, raw turmeric (haldi) and betel nut (supari) are ground using a stone grinder by ladies of the bride’s family. This turmeric- betel paste is then applied to the groom and bride’s face. A ceremonial bath is taken thereafter. 8am: Breakfast 10am-Noon : Sapthapadi &amp; Vivah Homa Havan The exchange of vows: A ceremonial fire ( Homa Havan ) is central to several Hindu ceremonies, including the exchange of wedding ( Vivah) vows. The couple take mutual oaths to be each other’s partners throughout life, with the fire, earth, priest &amp; Gods as their witness. The bridegroom applies Sindur (Kumkum) to the bride and ties her Mangal Sutra. The Mangal Sutra is a blackbead necklace with a gold pendant. Sapthapadi: Seven small heaps of rice with a betel- nut are arranged around the Home Havan. The groom leads the bride – placing her right foot on each of the rice heaps one step at a time – while the priest chants sacred verses. Each and every step of the Sapthapadi (7 steps) has a particular significance: health &amp; food (1 st ), strength (2 nd ), wealth (3 rd ), harmony (4 th ), children (5 th ), self- restraint (6 th ), eternal unity (7 th ). Once these seven steps are completed, the couple are declared as husband and wife. But, wait , the wedding has just begun! Have a lunch and perhaps and a short siesta. The Baraat will start at 4pm. Noon: Lunch 3pm: Tea &amp; Snacks ","Divya &amp; Vaibhav Sunday, December 10 (afternoon &amp; evening) 4-5pm : Gaurihaar &amp; Baraat The Bride wears a yellow saree presented to her by her Mama (maternal uncle) and a Mundaval (a pearl bridal lace headpiece). A statue of the Goddess of nourishment, Annapoorna Devi, and Balakrishna (Baby Krishna) are placed on a wooden board, around which 4 sets of 5 wooden pots are arranged by the bride’s family. The bride recites Shlokas (verses in Sanskrit) to the Goddess Gauri praying for good fortune and longevity of all. The Mama leads the bride to the wedding Mandap (place of the wedding), directly from this pooja, at the Muhurat (auspicious time of the wedding). The Groom : and his family are invited by the bride’s family to start the wedding procession (Baraat). Once the groom and the procession reaches the Mandap, the wedding procedures begin. The Baraat typically is the ceremony involving the most fanfare, which sometimes includes dancing. 5:55pm (Muhurat) : Manglashatak This is the most significant moment of the wedding. A cloth, known as AntarPat, is held between the bride and the groom – to signify their individual existence prior to the wedding. One edge of AntarPat is held by the bride’s Mama, while the other is held by the priest. Mangalashtak, eight stanza compositions in Sanskrit to seek blessings of various Gods, are sung. All the guests shower Akshata (blessed raw grains of rice) on the bride and the groom, at the end of each Mangalashtak. At the Muhurat (the auspicious time), the AntarPat is brought down and the couple exchange garlands. 6-7pm: Zaal and Lakshmi Poojan Zaal: In this ritual, 16 wheat dough lamps are made by the bride’s family and placed on a wooden basket, which is then placed on each elder member of the groom's family. This signifies that all the elder members of the groom's family take the responsibility of the bride. Lakshmi Poojan: The couple pray to Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity.. 7pm: Dinner "]
